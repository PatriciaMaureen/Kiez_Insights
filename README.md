# Kiez_Insights: Exploring Berlin's Community Data

# Context
Gie√ü den Kiez, a project by CityLAB Berlin, maps Berlin's 625.000+ street and park trees to protect them from drying out. The web app, www.giessdenkiez.de, allows users to explore, adopt, and water trees, aiding city watering services coordination and improvement.

# Goal
My goal was to gain some insights into the public data. Therefore I combined it with weather and socio-economic data. I wanted to explore the following points:
1. What kind of trees do we mostly have in the city of Berlin and how old are they?
2. Where are the trees that get watered located? Are the trees distributed throughout the city or is the project limited to individual districts? 
3. Is there a correlation between the socio-econimc status of a district and the behavior of watering?
4. Do the poeple water more on hot days?

# Outlook
I could already gain some interesting insights but I think there is even more you can learn about people's habits when you add more detailed user data. 
For example how do the people behave when there are special occasions happening in the city or when there are school vacations for the people that do have family.
